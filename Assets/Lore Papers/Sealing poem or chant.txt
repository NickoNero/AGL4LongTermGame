Engineer Dwarf or Priest/Warlock Dwarf maybe? Poem/chant that seals Artemis in bow. 
Aged paper texture. Could be in any level, but preferably towards the end since it gives away a lot of the lore imo.

Steel and stone,
Flesh and bone,
Goddess soul,
Trapped in bow.

Once up high,
Now down low,
Underneath the mountainâ€™s floor.

Closed the door,
No more gore,
Restlessness will roam no more.

Regin's mind,
Strength from Thor,
Make us what we were before.
