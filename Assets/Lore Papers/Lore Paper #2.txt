“Note to Self: never take an unpaid internship ever again, especially if it’s to be a messenger for Regin’s forge workers again...these other dwarves must have handles up their axes. The bag I was given to carry all of the letters in had a ripped seam at the bottom, and I didn’t even realize until I noticed them scattered across the halls behind me! I just hope I can find all of the papers before the boss throws me to the lava lizards.” 

This note is the second one found by the player, seen on Naseem's yellow Dwarven paper texture.
