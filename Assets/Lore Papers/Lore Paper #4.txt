“Update for my Elven worshippers: So far, negotiations with the Dwarves have been promising. Since I have arrived, they have decided to rename and remodel a temple in my honor as a gesture of goodwill towards brokering peace between our peoples. Once the temple is completed and the peace treaty is signed, they will give me an enchanted bow and quiver as a symbol of our new alliance. I am optimistic that this war will not end in blood as we had feared, but instead, with ink.”

This note is the fourth one found by the player, seen on Naseem's yellow Dwarven paper texture.
